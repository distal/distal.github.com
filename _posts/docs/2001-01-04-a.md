* ``| SEND <message> TO <locations>``: Sends the message to all specified protocols.
* ``| TRIGGER <message>``: basically send to this, except that the message is put in the front of this protocols queue.
* ``| AFTER <time> DO { <code> }``, executes code after ``<time>`` has passed, e.g., specified by ``1(SECONDS)``, ``5(MILLISECONDS)``.
* ``| DISCARD <messages>``: Mark this messages as not being used later (no later rule will match them).
