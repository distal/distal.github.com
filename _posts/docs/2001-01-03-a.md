* ``WITH`` (MessageType => Boolean): If predicate is true, the rule matches the message(s). Similar to WHERE.
* ``TIMES`` (=> Int): If the result of the computation equals the number of messages that match the other guards, the rule matches. Not really similar to COUNT.
* ``SAME``  (MessageType => T): Extracts some type ``T``, will match for all messages having the same extracted value. Similar to GROUP BY.
