Currently distal is not hosted in a maven repository, so in order to use it 
you have to build all the components locally. This means that you have to 
download (or clone) the ``distal-base`` and ``distal-dsl`` repositories, and 
call ``sbt publish-local`` in both of them. If you require also the sbt 
plugins (e.g., for ``sbt distal-run-local``) you have to do the same with 
``distal-sbtplugins``. Then you can use distal by including it as a library 
depency, just like any other scala-library: 

         libraryDependencies += "ch.epfl.lsr" %% "distal" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"

Note that, because distal requires scala macros you'll have to set ``scalaVersion := "2.10.1"`` or similar.
