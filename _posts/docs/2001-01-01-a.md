As Distal targets fault-tolerant distributed algorithms, its DSL is designed to resemble to
the pseudocode found in papers or books on the subject.
As we target algorithms for message-passing systems,
sending and receiving messages are the central elements of Distal.

Here's a basic example

        case class RoundMsg(rnd :Int) extends Message

        class SimpleRoundBasedProtocol(val ID :String) extends DSLProtocol {
          var round: Int = 0
          val MAJORITY = ALL.size/2 + 1

          UPON RECEIVING START DO {
            s =>
              round = round + 1
              | SEND RoundMsg(round) TO ALL
          }

          UPON RECEIVING RoundMsg WITH {_.rnd < round} DO {
            msg =>
              | DISCARD msg
          }

          UPON RECEIVING RoundMsg WITH {_.rnd == round} TIMES MAJORITY DO {
            msgs =>
              round = round + 1
              | SEND RoundMsg(round) TO ALL
              | TRIGGER STATECHANGED() // round has changed
              | DISCARD msgs
          }
        }

First we define a message (all messages need to extend ``Message`` and have a companion object). The we define a protocol, where processes send messages to all others, and proceed to the next round once a majority has been received from the current round. Messages from previous rounds are discarded.

Note that messages from the future are not handled (yet), this is why we ``TRIGGER STATECHANGED()`` in order to reevaluate guards for previously received (undiscarded) messages.
