Rules basically look like this:

      UPON RECEIVING <MESSAGE> <GUARD>* DO { <var> => <code> }

where ``<MESSAGE>`` is a message type (or rather its companion object), each ``<GUARD>`` is one of ``TIMES``, ``WITH``, and ``SAME`` (see below), ``<var>`` is a variable name that will be bound to the message (or set of messages) matched by this rule in the ``<code>`` that follows, which is basically any Scala code or any of DiStaL's actions (see below).
